        <p>If you want to blog these days, you have a number of choices.  You can use a free hosted service like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Google's Blogger</a> or the ever-hip <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, or you can host your own blog using something like <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.  Or, if you want a simple setup with no databases or WYSIWIG editors, you can go the static site generator route using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

      <p>If you're a web developer, chances are you've heard of or used Ruby on Rails to develop a web application. As a Ruby programmer, there are other options like Sinatra, but Rails is the dominant Ruby framework today (by at least one measure). PHP on the other hand has a number of MVC frameworks that you can experiment with. CakePHP, Zend, and CodeIgniter are just a few that come to mind; FuelPHP is a bit younger, but looks pretty interesting too.</p>

      <p>Have you ever been given a spreadsheet full of data that you need to use in an application?  Were you super not excited about copying and pasting the data from each cell for 2 hours?  The roo gem can be your bff when you have to read data from a spreadsheet.</p>

He is also a fan of libraries (the kind where you can check out books), and other things unrelated to computers.  Robert wants to help you learn and do stuff. He's on <a href="https://github.com/rsese">GitHub</a> and other Internet-y places, thinks you are all attractive people, and is enjoying speaking in the third person.
