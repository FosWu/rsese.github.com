  <p>I'm a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library">libraries</a>
(the kind where you can check out books). I'm sort of a programmer. I helped
start a non-profit that teaches people how to work with their computers. I
currently help the super attractive users of
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I'd probably like to help you learn
to do stuff. I'm on <a href="https://github.com/rsese">GitHub</a> - say
<a href="mailto:hi@hellarobots.com">hello</a>.</p>
