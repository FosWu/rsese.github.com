  <p>I'm a fan of libraries (the kind where you can check out books). I'm
sort of a programmer. I helped start a non-profit that helps teach people how
to work with their computers. I currently help the super attractive users of
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I'd probably like to help you learn to
do stuff. I'm on <a href="https://github.com/rsese">GitHub</a> - say
<a href="mailto:hi@hellarobots.com">hello</a>.</p>
